## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

- 🔁 **Strategy Pattern** – to handle multiple payment methods dynamically
- 🧍‍♂️ **Singleton Pattern** – to ensure only one instance of the central service
- 🔐 **Synchronization** – to manage thread-safe access to carts and stock
- 📊 **Separation of Concerns** – clean structure between service, model, and payment logic

---

## 🔒 Payment System Integration

Supports plug-and-play payment using the **Strategy Pattern**:

```java
PaymentStrategy payment = new CreditCardPayment("1234-5678-9999", "CVV123");
Order order = service.placeOrder("user123", payment);
